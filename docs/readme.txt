The goal of the game is to move the tiles to the center and solve the maze
puzzle.

The "File" menu allows you to load a maze file or save the current maze.
Pressing the "Reset" button will return tiles totheir original positions
and rotations from the start of the game. Pressingthe "Quit" button will
close the window.

Tiles are moved by clicking and dragging with the left mouse button. A tile
can be moved to any unoccupied slot. If you attempt to move a tile to an
occupied slot, a warning message will flash over the slot.

Tiles are rotated by right clicking on them while they are resting in their
slots. Tiles are always rotated clockwise by 90 degrees.
