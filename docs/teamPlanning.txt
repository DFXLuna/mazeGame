Group L Team:
Matt Grant - Testing and cleanup
Jared Frank - Front End
Adam Coggeshall - Front End
Alex Germann - Back End
Auston Larson - Back End

Planning:

All small issues are addressed via issue tickets in the main Github repo.
Planning and big picture stuff takes place in in-person meetings

Meeting 1:
    
    -Base design established
        -Development broken up into 2 portions
            -Front end handles gui and user interaction
            -Back end handles game objects and logic
    -Roles were assigned: Jared and Adam will handle the front end
    Alex and Auston will handle the backend. Matt will take care of
    anything else not directly related to those two.
    -Got everyone using Github, repos forked, cloned, synced
    -Made sure everyone would be able to do work independantly
        in their two man teams.

Meeting 2:
  
  -Figure out what the front end needs from the back end to draw and move tiles
    -Tile positions
  
  -Determine how the front end and back end will communicate
    -Implement a messenger interface, it's in charge of this communication
    -Messenger is a two way proxy between front and back ends
    
  -Implement drawing on the front end, maybe through drawer class
  
  -Decide onscreen tile position by position in array
  


Meeting 3:
  
    -Brief discussion of reading mze file, most of responsiblity lies in back end
    -Backend will pass necessary information to draw tile through the
    messenger to the front end.

Meeting 4:
  
  As usual Adam and Jared worked on the front end, while Auston and Alex
  did the back end. Matt helped with planning and logistics.
  
  -Figured out how the front end and back end would need to pass new data:
    -Front end retrieves tile rotations as integers from the messenger class.
    -Front end requests a rotation by calling functions in the messenger.
    -Front end requests reset/new game by calling functions in the messenger.
  
  -Fixed issues:
    -Renamed the tile holders so they would be easier to tell apart.
    -Cleaned up the GameTile class. Other classes were cleaned up later.
    -Modified tile moving method to return false upon failure to move a tile.
    
  Additional issues were handled after the meeting by communicating via Github
  and text messages.

Meeting 5:

    -The new specification for the mze filetype was discussed in regards to how
    the backend file reader needs to be changed. The changes weren't too
    drastic.
        -Added code to decide if the maze has been played or not via the magic
        numbers placed at the top of the file
        -The specific implementation of the code that places a tile had to be
        changed to allow the tile to be place in the main game grid
    -Loading and saving was briefly discussed, the menu was to be handled by
    the front end team and the actual saving and loading was to be handled by the
    back end team. The specifics were left to the teams.
